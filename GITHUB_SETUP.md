# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name:** `product-embeddings-fashion-retail`
   - **Description:** `Complete implementation of product embeddings for fashion retail with deep learning guide for beginners`
   - **Visibility:** Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, copy the repository URL and run:

```bash

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/product-embeddings-fashion-retail.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all the files uploaded
3. The README.md will display as the repository description
