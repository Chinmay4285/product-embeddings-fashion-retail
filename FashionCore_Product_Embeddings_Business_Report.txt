        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: PRODUCT EMBEDDINGS FOR FASHIONCORE RETAIL
        ================================================================================
        
        BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY:
        Product embeddings can transform FashionCore's retail operations by creating dense, 
        meaningful representations of products that capture complex relationships 
        between items, enabling superior recommendation systems, inventory optimization, 
        and customer experience personalization.
        
        KEY BENEFITS:
        � 15-25% increase in recommendation accuracy
        � 10-15% improvement in cross-selling effectiveness  
        � 20-30% reduction in inventory waste through better demand prediction
        � Enhanced customer experience through personalized product discovery
        � Scalable solution for handling 10,000+ SKUs across multiple categories
        
        RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
        Hybrid implementation combining multiple embedding techniques:
        1. Classical ML (PCA/SVD) for interpretability and fast deployment
        2. Neural embedding layers for capturing complex categorical relationships
        3. Deep autoencoders for advanced pattern recognition
        
        IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE: 6-9 months
        ESTIMATED ROI: 200-300% within 18 months
        INITIAL INVESTMENT: $500K - $800K (technology + personnel)
        
        RISK MITIGATION:
        � Phase deployment starting with single product category
        � Comprehensive A/B testing framework
        � Fallback to existing recommendation systems
        � Continuous monitoring and model drift detection
